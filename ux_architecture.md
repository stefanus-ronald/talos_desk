# UX Architecture Plan: Screen-to-RTSP ONVIF Bridge

## Executive Summary

This UX architecture plan defines a dual-interface system optimized for both simplicity and power: a minimal system tray interface for daily operations and a comprehensive native desktop configuration application. The architecture prioritizes "invisible when working, discoverable when needed" - enabling effortless operation for novice users while providing advanced capabilities for IT professionals.
