## Notes üìù

### Key Decisions Made
1. **Native Resolution Only**: Always capture at screen's native resolution
2. **C++ Desktop App**: Pure C++ with Dear ImGui (no web UI)
3. **Minimal Dependencies**: Avoid heavy frameworks
4. **Performance First**: Target <15% CPU from day one

### Important Reminders
- Always test with multiple monitors
- Test with 4K and high refresh displays  
- Verify VMS compatibility early and often
- Keep binary size under 25MB
- Maintain cross-platform compatibility
- Follow secure coding practices
