## [Unreleased]

### Week 4 Completed - 2025-08-02 (Evening)
- **Memory Management & Optimization System**:
  - Lock-free circular buffer implementation with atomic operations for producer-consumer patterns
  - Advanced memory pool with frame-specific buckets and automatic sizing
  - Zero-copy pipeline optimization using shared buffers with reference counting
  - Comprehensive memory leak detection with stack trace capture and real-time monitoring
  - Performance profiling system with detailed timing statistics, percentiles, and system metrics
  - Cross-platform memory alignment support (Windows, Linux, macOS)
  - Thread-safe operations with minimal contention and high-performance design
- **Build System Enhancements**:
  - Added all memory management components to CMake build system
  - Fixed compilation errors related to std::mutex move semantics
  - Updated SharedBuffer to inherit from std::enable_shared_from_this
  - Successfully builds on macOS with all Week 4 components
- **Code Quality**:
  - Comprehensive error handling and validation
  - RAII patterns for automatic resource management
  - Template metaprogramming for type-safe memory management
  - Real-time monitoring and alerting capabilities

- Successfully building on macOS (arm64)

### Week 3 Completed - 2025-08-02 (PM)
- FFmpeg video encoder implementation:
  - H.264 software encoding with hardware acceleration detection
  - Support for H.265/HEVC and AV1 codecs
  - Quality presets (ultrafast to veryslow)
  - CRF and bitrate control
  - Frame format conversion (BGRA to YUV420P)
  - Encoder performance monitoring and statistics
- macOS screen capture implementation:
  - AVFoundation-based capture using AVCaptureScreenInput
  - Native resolution detection and capture
  - Multi-monitor enumeration and selection
  - Frame queuing with overflow protection
  - Timestamp generation in microseconds
- Factory methods for platform-specific capture engines

- Application successfully builds and runs on macOS with capture and encoding support

### Week 2 Completed - 2025-08-02 (AM)
- Windows Desktop Duplication API wrapper implementation
- Windows-specific capture engine with native resolution support
- External dependencies integration:
  - FFmpeg 5.0+ with CMake find module
