## Notes üìù

### Key Decisions Made
1. **Native Resolution Only**: Always capture at screen's native resolution
2. **C++ Desktop App**: Pure C++ with Dear ImGui (no web UI)
3. **Minimal Dependencies**: Avoid heavy frameworks
4. **Performance First**: Target <15% CPU from day one
5. **Build System**: CMake 3.20+ with platform-specific scripts
6. **Architecture**: Modular design with clear interface separation

### Recent Accomplishments (2025-08-02)
- ‚úÖ Complete CMake build system implementation
- ‚úÖ Platform-specific build scripts (Windows .bat, macOS/Linux .sh)
- ‚úÖ Core application framework with proper architecture
- ‚úÖ Interface definitions for all major components
- ‚úÖ Successfully builds and runs on macOS
- ‚úÖ Command-line argument parsing
- ‚úÖ JSON configuration system framework

### Important Reminders
- Always test with multiple monitors
- Test with 4K and high refresh displays  
- Verify VMS compatibility early and often
- Keep binary size under 25MB
- Maintain cross-platform compatibility
- Follow secure coding practices
